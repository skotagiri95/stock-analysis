# BACKGROUND
The purpose of this project is to analyze stock trends using VBA Macros. VBA Macros are a useful tool because they eliminate the potential for human error when performing basic mathematical analysis. The project analyzes stock trends over two years and provides clients with insightful data on which stocks to invest in for the most monetary return. There are two important colums provided in the data set, "total daily volume" and "return." "Total daily volume" tells clients the total turnover rate for specific shares and "return" showcases the profitability of specific stocks.
